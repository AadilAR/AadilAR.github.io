 We're a little depressed. Tea solves all these problems in one delightful little cup.</blockquote>

<p>Tea preparation is the process of turning tea leaves into a beverage. 
While the particular steps vary with the type of tea and with the raw materials, 
the process generally includes several steps: tea leaves are harvested, processed, and then brewed to extract flavors.</p>

<p>Tea can be brewed using various methods such as steeping, boiling, or cold brewing.
 In most areas, tea may be purchased as loose leaves, in tea bags, or as pre-packaged tea blends.
 Tea is often packaged to ensure freshness and flavor preservation.</p>
